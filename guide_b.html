        <h1>Make A Friend Machine</h1>

<img src="https://www.spieltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Poppy-Playtime-Make-A-Friend-Machine.jpg" style="width:100%">

<p>In the very first chapter of this horror puzzle game, you are introduced to the Playtime Co. toy factory. You must use Playtime Co.’s GrabPack to solve puzzles and rewire circuits in order to restore power to the factory’s many machines. Once you get the red GrabPack hand you must travel down the conveyer belt.</p>

<p>Here you’ll enter into a room with a large sign reading “Make-A-Friend” over three large machines. On the exit door of this room, you’ll see “Nobody leaves without a toy” and the door will be locked. You’ll see a platform next to this door that will allow you to scan a toy. So, you need to create one using the Make-A-Friend machine and for that, you must power it on.</h1>

<h1>Unlocking the Security Door Puzzle</h1>

<p>Once you’ve watched the video turn to the right and enter the Gift Shop. Inside the Gift Shop look at the ceiling for a train running on a suspended track. Make a note of the colors you see on the train. Leave the Gift Shop and head back through the reception area into Security. Here you will find a locked door with a colored keypad. Push the colors that were on the train to open the door. The solution is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Green.</li>
    <li>Pink.</li>
    <li>Yellow.</li>
    <li>Red.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you input the colors listed above you will unlock the door. Head through the door into the Security Office. Here we will get a few important items.</p>

<h1>Blue Tape Location and Getting Blue Hand</h1>

<p>When running away, stay crouched and avoid the enemies you encounter by keeping a safe distance.

After reaching the street, wait for the right moment to sneak into the neighboring building - you will learn how to lean out of a cover.</p>

<h1>Get to the sewers</h1>

<p>Inside the lobby you will see a few interesting things. The first, and most prominent, is the large toy creature named Huggy Wuggy in the center of the room. Huggy Wuggy is the toy that chases you throughout this chapter. The second thing you will notice is that there are seven doors in this room. These doors lead to different areas of the factory.</p>

<p>Before going through any of the doors we need to grab the Yellow Power Room Key dangling from the giant toys hand using your blue hand. To do this shoot the blue hand door to the left. The door won’t open because it has no power. When you do this the Yellow Key will drop into the creatures upraised hand. Use your hand to grab it.</p>

<h1>Turn the Power Back On</h1>

<p>Once you have the Yellow Key make your way to the door labelled Power. Go through the doors and into the Power generating room. Inside this room we need to get the power back up and running.</p>

<h1>Complete the Conveyor Circuit Puzzle</h1>

<img src="https://c.tenor.com/A8nYW41OQTMAAAAC/poppy-playtime-poppy.gif" style="width:100%">

<p>At the bottom of the conveyor belt you will be stuck. To advance you need to complete a circuit. Right where you land take a right and walk along the conveyor belt there until you reach a ramp leading up. Go up this ramp and look to the right. There is socket here. Shoot the socket with one of your hands (leave it connected). Turnaround and walk down the ramp to get around the electricity pole. Head back to the entrance and walk towards the door. Look left and shoot the socket there to complete the circuit. You will automatically move forward along the belt. Ride the belt until you reach the room at the end.</p>
